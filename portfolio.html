        <p>Breakout is modeled after the Breakout arcade video game that was developed by
        Atari, Inc. It has three unique levels and a power-up system. It was developed as a project
        in my Software Design class and co-authored by my peers Shannon Seignious and Amillion Kearse.</p>

        <p class = "title"><strong>Baby Names</strong></p>
        <p>Using a text file provided by the US Social Security Administration, the file contains popular baby names from each year by gender. The
        program reads in the data, stores it in a dictionary and then allows the user to runs queries interactively. Queries include
        showing the most popular name for a given year and gender, showing rank for a given name, gender, and year, and finding the year in which the given name and
        gender combination was the most popular. Additionally queries are not avaliable to the user, but have been developed and tested to
        demonstrate understanding of JUnit.  </p>

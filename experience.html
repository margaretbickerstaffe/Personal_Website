        <h2>INTERNSHIP</h2>
        <p><strong>Web and Mobile Application Development Internship at Memido</strong></p>
        <p>March 2021 to May 2021</p>
        <p><em>Berlin, Germany</em></p>
      </div>
      <div class="internshipSummary">
        <p>Memido, formally known as MiProbes, is a health and wellness start-up company located in Berlin, Germany. The business
        is focused around their at-home urine tests that can be used to measure health, hydration, kidney health,
        and immunity.</p>
        <p>At Memido, I worked on their website and mobile application to implement new features and help to improve
        their systems that they used to collect data. While I was working with Memido, the monthly goals included growing customer reach and increasing fundraising
        My first project at the internship involved implementing Mailchimp into the application. I used the onboarding questions
        to add customers to appropriate email lists depending on their interests. I also had to ensure that all work I did in the application
        worked in both iOS and Android.</p>
        <p>My next project was creating a "Waiting For Results" pop-up that would display in the application after the user submitted
        a test, but before their results were uploaded. I then developed a push-notification that would be triggered once someone's
        results were uploaded, but before their results were avaliable. I also created pop-up that asked for app feedback from the user every so often. My final assignment was to create
        reports page that was only accessible to administrators. This page collected and displayed the demographics of the current users as well as
        broke down different usages of the app based on the user's groups.</p>
        <p>For every project, I developed detailed documentation on what I done and how I had done it. I also extensively tested every implementation
        in the app before the newest version of the app was published.</p>

        <h2>UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH</h2>
        <p><strong>An Agent-Based Modeling Approach to Food Deserts</strong></p>
        <p>August 2021 to May 2023</p>
        <p><em>Elon University</em></p>
      </div>
        <div class="researchSummary">
          <p>During my four years at Elon I have had the pleasure of being a part of the Elon College Fellows. During my first three years
          the program included taking a variety of classes and semniars designed to teach us how to conduct research. In my sophomore, I had to
          conduct faculty interviews and narrow down on a research topic. Then during my third and fourth year, I dove fully into my personal project,
          with the help of my faculty mentor. I had the oppurtunity to present this work at the Computational Social Science Society of the America's Annual
          Conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico in October of 2022. Through this project I learned how challenging it can be to solve problems within in the social sciences
          and feel that I have gained irreplaceable experiences. </p>

        <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Food deserts are places where there is minimal access to healthy and affordable food in the surrounding area. Without the ability to acquire healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, people are much less likely to incorporate them into their diet. Most often, people living in these areas will instead consume unhealthier options because they are more readily available. This diet can lead to a variety of chronic health diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, food deserts are classified as a public health issue. Computational social science lets us study societal problems with computer simulations. Through agent-based modeling we can create artificial worlds where micro-level effects can be studied on a macro-level. It is in this artificial world that the model demonstrates an entire societal process where we can study different variables and see how they change the outcome. In its current state, our model maps the impact that a community organizer can have on bringing healthy foods into homes through home/community gardening. Home gardens offer people agency over what they consume and is a great way to regulate mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health.  The modelâ€™s components include people (agents, n = 100) with attributes of hardship, influence, and organizer status (0 or 1). Agents move randomly throughout the model and if they bump into the organizer, they have a chance to be convinced to start or join a garden pending their hardship level and the influence of the organizer. Eventually a community garden can be started once enough members are available to organize it. This model helps to visualize the impact of home gardening on increasing fruits and vegetable levels in homes, and therefore giving people autonomy over their foods. The model will help to demonstrate the effectiveness of additional community organizers and a global lowering of hardship on the number of home gardens. We expect to use conversations with local community gardening organizations as a basis for more accurate rates of organizer success and will use those to draw results.

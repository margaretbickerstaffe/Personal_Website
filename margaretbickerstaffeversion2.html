        <p><strong>MARGARET BICKERSTAFFE</strong></p>
        <p> Hi, my name is Maggie Bickerstaffe (she/her) and I am a student at Elon University in my senior year of studies. I am majoring in
        Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Classical Studies. During my time at
        Elon I have been able to complete a 2 year long research project, study and work in Berlin, mentor
        younger students, work 3 on-campus jobs, and much much more. </p>
        <p>I grew up in New Jersery my entire life before moving to North Carolina to study at Elon.
        I look forward to entering my next stage of life in the professional world. Right now I am
        currently pursuing jobs within the tech industry, specifically full-stack development. </p>
        <p>Much of my time at Elon has been focused on researching within the world of Computational Social Science. When I
        entered the field of computer science I was worried that I wouldn't be able to make a difference in the
        areas of the world that I care about most. In this field I learned how we can used computer science to
        contribute to solutions for the world's greatest probelms. My current research has been focused on studying solutions
        to food insecurity, particularily in Alamance County, where Elon University is located. </p>

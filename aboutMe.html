        <p><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
        <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Maggie Bickerstaffe</strong> and I am a 22 year old computer science student at
        Elon University. From the time I was a child I have always loved solving puzzles, which I think is
        part of the reason I chose to go into computer science. It took me a long time to choose a major,
        but after realizing my favorite classes were Calculus and General Chemistry, I decided to pursue a field that
        was more mathematics based. I love that in Computer Science I get to both write and solve puzzles.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I enjoy taking time away from my computer to read(Emily Henry is the current
        favorite author), hike, listen to music, and dedicate time to my sketchbook, which is mostly dedictaed to architectural
        sketches. I also love to travel which I got to expereince a lot of during my semester in Berlin, Germany. In the picture on the
        right I am outside of Copenhagen's city hall!</p>
        <p>My friends would describe me as creative, honest, and loyal. I am always interested in a new adventure and cannot wait to
        enter the next phase of my life in the professional work force. </p>
        <p>Please explore my site and reach out to me with any inquiries.My email is <u>mbickerstaffe@elon.edu</u> and
        my resume can be accessed above.</p>
